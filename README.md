### README.md
#### d3.js tutorials

I chose to do tutorials on d3 because it is a versatile js data visualization library and I would love to incorporate data visualizations into my project.

I worked on a data vis team this summer, specifically building a map component, and chose to use a different framework. My second choice was d3, and so I've wanted to learn it ever since.
